# RFC #028: Add Healthcheck System

## Description

Implement a periodic healthcheck system to monitor extension health, including pane count monitoring and environment configuration validation (e.g., checking if dependencies are still properly installed).

## Requirements

- Periodic healthcheck system
- Pane count monitoring
- Environment configuration validation
- Dependency status checking
- User notification system for issues
- Automatic recovery mechanisms

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Periodic healthcheck runs automatically
- [ ] Pane count is monitored and reported
- [ ] Environment configuration is validated
- [ ] Dependency status is checked
- [ ] Users are notified of issues
- [ ] Automatic recovery is attempted when possible
- [ ] Healthcheck results are logged and accessible

## Priority

Medium - Reliability and monitoring

## Labels

enhancement, monitoring, healthcheck, reliability, diagnostics

## Status

**PENDING** - New feature request

## Technical Details

### Healthcheck Components

1. **Pane Monitoring**: Track number of open data viewer panes
2. **Environment Validation**: Check Python environment and dependencies
3. **Configuration Check**: Validate extension settings
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Track memory usage and response times
5. **Error Tracking**: Monitor and report recurring errors

### Monitoring Frequency

- **Real-time**: Immediate checks on critical operations
- **Periodic**: Regular background checks (every 5-10 minutes)
- **On-demand**: Manual healthcheck trigger
- **Event-driven**: Checks triggered by specific events

### Implementation Considerations

1. **Non-intrusive**: Healthcheck should not impact user experience
2. **Configurable**: Users should be able to adjust monitoring settings
3. **Efficient**: Minimal performance impact
4. **Comprehensive**: Cover all critical system components
5. **Actionable**: Provide clear guidance for resolving issues
