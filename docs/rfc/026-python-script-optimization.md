# RFC #026: Optimize Python Script Calls

## Description

Reduce the number of Python script calls by implementing a more efficient communication mechanism. Currently, too many calls are made to Python scripts, and only one should be necessary for optimal performance.

## Requirements

- Reduce Python script calls to minimum necessary
- Implement efficient data communication mechanism
- Cache results to avoid redundant calls
- Optimize data transfer between TypeScript and Python
- Maintain existing functionality while improving performance

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Single Python script call per data operation
- [ ] Efficient data caching mechanism
- [ ] Reduced communication overhead
- [ ] Maintained functionality and reliability
- [ ] Performance improvements measured and documented
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained

## Priority

High - Performance optimization

## Labels

enhancement, performance, optimization, python-integration

## Status

**PENDING** - Performance improvement

## Technical Details

### Current Issues

The extension currently makes multiple Python script calls for:

- Data information retrieval
- Format detection
- Metadata extraction
- Visualization data preparation

### Optimization Strategy

1. **Single Script Approach**: Combine multiple operations into one Python script call
2. **Data Caching**: Cache results to avoid redundant processing
3. **Batch Operations**: Process multiple requests in a single call
4. **Efficient Serialization**: Optimize data transfer format

### Implementation Considerations

1. **Script Consolidation**: Merge multiple Python scripts into one comprehensive script
2. **Caching Layer**: Implement intelligent caching for frequently accessed data
3. **Data Compression**: Use efficient serialization for large datasets
4. **Error Handling**: Maintain robust error handling with consolidated calls
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Add metrics to measure improvement

## Related Issues

- Performance optimization across the entire extension
- May require updates to multiple existing RFCs
- Could impact RFC #007 (lazy initialization)
