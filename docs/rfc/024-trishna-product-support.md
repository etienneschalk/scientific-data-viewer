# RFC #024: Support Trishna Product with Custom Scripts

## Description

Add support for Trishna satellite products with the possibility for users to register custom scripts in their HOME directory for specialized data processing and visualization.

## Requirements

- Support for Trishna product format
- Custom script registration system in user HOME directory
- Plugin-like architecture for custom data processors
- Documentation for creating custom Trishna scripts
- Integration with existing custom script system

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Trishna product files can be opened
- [ ] Custom scripts can be registered in user HOME directory
- [ ] Custom scripts receive product path as input
- [ ] Plugin architecture supports Trishna-specific processing
- [ ] Documentation for Trishna script development
- [ ] Integration with existing custom script framework

## Priority

Medium - Specialized satellite data support

## Labels

## Status

**PENDING** - New feature request

## Technical Details

### Trishna Product Format

Trishna (Thermal Infra-Red Imaging Satellite for High-resolution Natural resource Assessment) products may have specific:

- Data structure requirements
- Metadata format
- Spectral band organization
- Georeferencing information

### Custom Script System

Users should be able to:

1. Place custom scripts in `~/.scientific-data-viewer/scripts/trishna/`
2. Scripts receive the product path as a command-line argument
3. Scripts return structured data for visualization
4. Scripts can define custom visualization parameters

### Implementation Considerations

1. **Script Discovery**: Scan user HOME directory for custom scripts
2. **Script Execution**: Safe execution of user-provided scripts
3. **Data Interface**: Standardized input/output format for scripts
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of script errors
5. **Security**: Sandboxed execution of custom scripts

- Extends RFC #010 (custom scripts)
- May require updates to RFC #001 (format support)
