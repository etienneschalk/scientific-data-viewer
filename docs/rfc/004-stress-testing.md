# Issue #004: Stress testing with many small variables

## Description

Create comprehensive stress testing to ensure UI robustness when handling datasets with many small variables.

## Requirements

- Generate fake test data with many small variables
- Test UI performance and responsiveness with large numbers of variables
- Identify and fix any performance bottlenecks
- Ensure memory usage remains reasonable

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Test data generator creates datasets with many small variables
- [ ] UI remains responsive with large variable counts
- [ ] Memory usage is optimized for large datasets
- [ ] Performance benchmarks are established

## Priority

Medium - Quality assurance

## Labels
