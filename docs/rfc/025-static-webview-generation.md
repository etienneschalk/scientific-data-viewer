# RFC #025: Generate Static Webview via Notebook

## Description

Enable users to register scripts that receive the path to a product and generate a static webview representation. This allows for custom visualization and export capabilities through notebook-based processing.

## Requirements

- Static webview generation system
- User script registration for product processing
- Notebook-based processing pipeline
- Export functionality for static webviews
- Integration with existing webview system

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Users can register scripts for static webview generation
- [ ] Scripts receive product path as input
- [ ] Static webviews can be generated and exported
- [ ] Notebook integration for processing pipeline
- [ ] Export formats: HTML, PNG, PDF
- [ ] Integration with existing webview architecture

## Priority

Medium - Export and visualization enhancement

## Labels

enhancement, static-webview, notebook, export, custom-scripts

## Status

**PENDING** - New feature request

## Technical Details

### Static Webview Generation

The system should support:

1. **Script Registration**: Users register scripts in a designated directory
2. **Product Processing**: Scripts receive product path and generate visualization data
3. **Webview Creation**: Convert processed data to static HTML/CSS/JS
4. **Export Options**: Multiple export formats (HTML, PNG, PDF)

### Notebook Integration

- Jupyter notebook support for interactive processing
- Script execution within notebook environment
- Visualization generation using notebook tools
- Export capabilities from notebook

### Implementation Considerations

1. **Script Interface**: Standardized input/output format
2. **Security**: Safe execution of user scripts
3. **Performance**: Efficient processing of large datasets
4. **Export Quality**: High-quality static representations
5. **File Management**: Proper handling of generated files

## Related Issues

- Builds upon RFC #010 (custom scripts)
- May integrate with RFC #005 (export notebook)
- Could enhance RFC #011 (export visualization)
