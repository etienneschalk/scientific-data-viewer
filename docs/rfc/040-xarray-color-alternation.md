# RFC #040: Xarray Color Alternation

## Description

Implement color alternation for xarray plots similar to the native xarray plotting behavior, providing consistent and visually appealing color schemes across different plot types.

## Requirements

- Implement xarray-style color cycling
- Support different color palettes
- Maintain color consistency across plot types
- Provide color customization options
- Support both discrete and continuous color schemes
- Handle color accessibility (colorblind-friendly)
- Integrate with existing plotting system
- Support color legend generation

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Color alternation matches xarray behavior
- [ ] Multiple color palettes are available
- [ ] Color consistency is maintained
- [ ] Customization options are provided
- [ ] Accessibility is considered
- [ ] Integration with existing plots works
- [ ] Color legends are generated
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
