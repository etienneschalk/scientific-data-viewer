# RFC #023: Support Tiling Grid S2 (Sentinel-2 SAFE)

## Description

Add support for Sentinel-2 SAFE format with proper tiling grid handling. This requires recoding the reader to properly handle Sentinel-2's specific data structure and tiling system.

## Requirements

- Support for Sentinel-2 SAFE format (.safe directories)
- Proper handling of Sentinel-2 tiling grid system
- Recode the data reader to handle Sentinel-2 specific structure
- Support for Sentinel-2 L1C and L2A products
- Integration with existing format support system

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Sentinel-2 SAFE files can be opened and visualized
- [ ] Tiling grid is properly displayed and navigable
- [ ] Support for both L1C and L2A product levels
- [ ] Proper metadata extraction from Sentinel-2 products
- [ ] Integration with existing xarray-sentinel dependency
- [ ] Performance optimization for large Sentinel-2 datasets

## Priority

High - Core functionality enhancement

## Labels

enhancement, sentinel2, safe-format, tiling-grid, satellite-data

## Status

**PENDING** - New feature request

## Technical Details

### Sentinel-2 SAFE Format Structure

Sentinel-2 products use a specific directory structure:

- `MTD_MSIL1C.xml` or `MTD_MSIL2A.xml` (metadata)
- `GRANULE/` directory containing tiled data
- `AUX_DATA/` for auxiliary data
- `DATASTRIP/` for data strips

### Tiling Grid System

Sentinel-2 uses a specific tiling grid system:

- 100km x 100km tiles
- UTM projection
- Specific naming convention for tiles
- Multiple spectral bands per tile

### Implementation Considerations

1. **Dependency Management**: Ensure xarray-sentinel is properly integrated
2. **Memory Management**: Handle large datasets efficiently
3. **UI Integration**: Display tiling information in the data viewer
4. **Performance**: Optimize loading for large Sentinel-2 products

## Related Issues

- Builds upon RFC #001 (format support)
- May require updates to RFC #010 (custom scripts) for specialized visualization
